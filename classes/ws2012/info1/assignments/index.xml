It can be analog (i.e. on paper) or digital. Make sure that you label and date your logbook. Keep track of everything you do in the logbook – even if you are really excited and want to keep playing. You will save time later if you can easily retrace your steps. Your lab leader will show you how to set up an online logbook.</description></item></channel></rss>
