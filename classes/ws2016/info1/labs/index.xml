Each computer in WH C 576 and WH C 579 is a so-called dual-boot computer that can boot to Windows or Ubuntu Linux, or Mac OS in WH C 537. As computer science students we expect you to be able to deal with Windows, Unix, and Mac OS operating systems.
We have lots of rules for the labs, as they are used by many different people during the week.</description></item></channel></rss>
