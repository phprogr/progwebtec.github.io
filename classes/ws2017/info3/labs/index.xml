Read it as a preparation for the lab.
Assignment As a finger exercise for Sequence Diagrams, pick one of the following example projects from the first semester and draw a sequence diagram for the main use case:
The Clock Display / Use case: timeTick() is called Auction / Use case: makeABid() is called Tech Support / Use case: user command is entered (start() method in SupportSystem) The Zuul Project / Use case: user enters command (method: play() in Game.</description></item><item><title>Assignment 04: Testing</title><link>https://progwebtec.github.io/classes/ws2017/info3/labs/lab-04-testing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://progwebtec.github.io/classes/ws2017/info3/labs/lab-04-testing/</guid><description>Test Button in Car.

A. Black and White Box Tests In addition to what we&amp;rsquo;ve covered in class, please have a look at black-box and white-box testing.
Getting started: Give the equivalence classes for testing a method that determines the absolute value of an integer using the black-box methodology.

Revised - without significant changes to the assignment itself except taking out Factory Girl/Bot - on 1/1/18. If you&amp;rsquo;ve started working on this assignment before, you can view the changes in the commit &amp;ldquo;info3 - revised lab 06&amp;rdquo; on bkleinen.github.ioPrelab The Base Repo (referred to as main repository below) for this Lab is the HTW Application we&amp;rsquo;ve developed in class, see https://github.com/htw-imi-info3/rails-dash-ws2017 - first fork it on github (only one person in your team needs to do this) and then clone it to your local workspace (computer).</description></item><item><title>Assignment 07 - Search &amp; Sort, Internationalization</title><link>https://progwebtec.github.io/classes/ws2017/info3/labs/lab-07-rails-2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://progwebtec.github.io/classes/ws2017/info3/labs/lab-07-rails-2/</guid><description>Assignment Part 1: Add a Sort or Search Functionality Each Group should add a sort or search functionality to one of the resources pages of the HTW app. We will coordinate the tasks using issues on the repository, see https://github.com/htw-imi-info3/rails-dash-ws2017/issues, and also coordinate within the lab.
See the Guide on the Active Record Query Interface - it contains all necessary information on how to query and sort Pumpkins and other stuff.</description></item><item><title>Exercise 01 - Case Studies of Ethical Questions</title><link>https://progwebtec.github.io/classes/ws2017/info3/labs/lab-01-casestudies/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://progwebtec.github.io/classes/ws2017/info3/labs/lab-01-casestudies/</guid><description>The German &amp;lsquo;&amp;lsquo;Gesellschaft f√ºr Informatik&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo; published Ethical Guidelines in 1994 that were updated in 2004. They are available online at https://fg-ie.gi.de/ethische-leitlinien.html.
We will first have a closer look at the Ethical Guidelines, and then in groups of 3-4 persons you will choose one of the scenarios to read, discuss, and present to the class. Every member of the group will submit their own PDF version with a reflection on the scenario and how the Ethical Guidelines apply to this case.</description></item><item><title>Exercise 01 - Installation Instructions</title><link>https://progwebtec.github.io/classes/ws2017/info3/labs/lab-01-startup-installation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://progwebtec.github.io/classes/ws2017/info3/labs/lab-01-startup-installation/</guid><description>(These are detailled instructions for the installation part of the Info 3 Startup Lab).
Which Computer to use? As most of your colleagues in the former semesters completely ignored the new iMacs in our Web Technology lab and rather unfolded tiny notebooks in front of the 27&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo; screens (which unfortunatley even cannot be used as an external monitor), I expect that you will also mainly use your personal computers for working on the exercises.</description></item><item><title>Exercise 01 - Lab Startup and Ruby Finger Exercises</title><link>https://progwebtec.github.io/classes/ws2017/info3/labs/lab-01-startup/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://progwebtec.github.io/classes/ws2017/info3/labs/lab-01-startup/</guid><description>Nerd Workplace.

Part 1: Setting up your environment Make sure that you have
ruby, rails, git, a decent text editor installed on the computer you intend to use (or know how to run all these on the lab machines).</description></item></channel></rss>
