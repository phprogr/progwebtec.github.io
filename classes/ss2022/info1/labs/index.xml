Pre-Lab Download the Scenarios and read through the Kara programming exercises in the assignment.
Write down how Kara could solve the task for each one of them. For example, if the programming exercise was Exercise 4 from Worksheet 1, where Kara was to move in a Square and drop a leaf in each corner, you could write down something as this:</description></item><item><title>Exercise 02: TicketMachine</title><link>https://progwebtec.github.io/classes/ss2022/info1/labs/exercise-02/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://progwebtec.github.io/classes/ss2022/info1/labs/exercise-02/</guid><description>Printed Ticket.

Pre-lab 0. What could be wrong with the following constructor? Don&amp;rsquo;t execute it, think about it in your head.
public TicketMachine (int ticketCost) { int price = ticketCost; balance = 0; total = 0; } 1. How can you tell the difference between a method and a constructor just by looking at its header?
2. What do you think would be printed if you altered the fourth statement of printTicket so that price also has quotes around it, as follows: System.</description></item></channel></rss>
